The goal is to find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target number and return their indices.\\n\\nExplanation of the code:\\n1. The `twoSum` function takes in a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, and it returns a list of two integers representing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.\\n2. It initializes an empty dictionary `d` to store the numbers and their indices.\\n3. It iterates over the list `nums` using the `enumerate` function, which provides both the index `i` and the value `j`.\\n4. For each number `j`, it calculates the complement `r` by subtracting `j` from the `target`.\\n5. If the complement `r` is already in the dictionary `d`, it means we have found the pair that adds up to the target, so it returns the indices of the two numbers.\\n6. If the complement is not in the dictionary, it adds the current number `j` to the dictionary with its index `i`.\\n7. If no pair is found in the entire list, it implicitly returns `None`.\\n\\nData structures used:\\n- Dictionary (`d`): Used to store the numbers as keys and their indices as values. This allows for constant time lookups to check if the complement is already in the dictionary.\\n\\nTime complexity analysis:\\n- The code has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the `nums` list. This is because we iterate through the list only once.\\n\\nSpace complexity analysis:\\n- The space complexity is O(n) as well, where n is the number of elements in the `nums` list. This is because the dictionary `d` can potentially store all the elements of the list.\\n\\nOverall, this code efficiently solves the Two Sum problem in linear time complexity and linear space complexity.'"]},"execution_count":19,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["response.choices[0].message.content"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-V29SKtZD1Dd"},"source":["### 하나씩 실행"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"PRzkD_1uQte0"},"outputs":[],"source":["def get_openai_response(row):\n","  prompt = f\"\"\"Below is the code for LeetCode problem {row['id']}.

given code is a Python solution to the problem of finding the maximum area of water that can be stored by two vertical lines in an array. Let's break down the code and analyze it in detail:\\n\\n1. **Data Structures Used**:\\n   - The code uses a two-pointer approach to solve the problem efficiently. It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the left and right boundaries of the container.\\n   - The code also uses a variable `m` to store the maximum area found so far.\\n   - The input `height` is a list of integers representing the heights of the vertical lines.\\n\\n2. **Explanation**:\\n   - The function `maxArea` takes a list of integers `height` as input and returns the maximum area that can be contained by two vertical lines.\\n   - It initializes the left pointer `l` to 0 and the right pointer `r` to the last index of the `height` list.\\n   - It initializes the maximum area `m` to 0.\\n   - It then iterates using a while loop until the left pointer is less than the right pointer.\\n   - It calculates the area between the two vertical lines at pointers `l` and `r` using the formula `area = (r - l) * min(height[r], height[l])`.\\n   - It updates the maximum area `m` if the current area is greater.\\n   - It then moves the pointer with the smaller height towards the center to potentially find a larger area.\\n   - Finally, it returns the maximum area `m` found during the iteration.\\n\\n3. **Time Complexity**:\\n   - The time complexity of the code is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the `height` list. The two-pointer approach allows us to find the maximum area in a single pass through the list.\\n\\n4. **Space Complexity**:\\n   - The space complexity of the code is O(1) as the extra space used is constant and does not depend on the input size.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the given code efficiently finds the maximum area of water that can be stored by two vertical lines using a two-pointer approach,

where we are required to find common characters that appear in all strings within the input list of words.\\n\\nHere's a detailed explanation of the code:\\n\\n1. The `commonChars` function takes a list of strings `words` as input and returns a list of characters that are common in all strings.\\n\\n2. It initializes the variable `f` to the first word in the list `words`.\\n\\n3. If the length of the input list `words` is 1, it returns a list of characters in the first word `f`.\\n\\n4. It then converts each word in the list `words` (except the first word) into a list of characters and stores them in the `words` variable.\\n\\n5. It initializes an empty list `lst` to store the common characters found in all words.\\n\\n6. It uses a nested loop to iterate over each character in the first word `f`. For each character, it checks if that character is present in all other words in the list by iterating over the list of words.\\n\\n7. If a character is found in all words, it removes that character from the respective word and increments the counter `c`.\\n\\n8. If the counter `c` is equal to the length of the list of words, it means the character is common in all words, so it appends that character to the `lst`.\\n\\n9. Finally, it returns the list `lst` containing common characters found in all words.\\n\\nNow, let's analyze the time and space complexity of the code:\\n\\n- Time Complexity: Let `n` be the total number of characters in all words and `m` be the number of words in the input list. The code has a nested loop that iterates over each character in the first word and then iterates over each word in the list. So, the time complexity is O(n * m).\\n\\n- Space Complexity: The code uses additional space to store the first word `f`, the list of words, and the list `lst` to store common characters. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the characters and O(m) for storing the list of words. Thus, the overall space complexity is O(n + m).\\n\\nOverall, the code efficiently finds common characters in all words while maintaining a reasonable time and space complexity for the given problem.\",\n          \"```python\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    '''\\n       As we know inorder to check if a triangle is valid or not, if its sides are given:=>\\n       A triangle is a valid triangle, If and only If, the sum of any two sides of a triangle is \\n       greater than the third side.

It uses a two-pointer approach to find the number of valid triangles that can be formed with the side at the given index.\\n   - The `triangleNumber` method first checks if the length of the input array is less than 3 and returns 0 in that case.\\n   - It then sorts the input array `nums` in non-decreasing order.\\n   - It iterates from index 2 to the end of the array and calls the `isValidTriangle` method for each index to count the valid triangles that can be formed using that side length.\\n   - The total count of valid triangles is accumulated and returned as the final result.\\n\\n3. **Time Complexity**:\\n   - The time complexity of the code is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.\\n     - Sorting the array takes O(nlogn) time.\\n     - The `isValidTriangle` method uses a two-pointer approach, which runs in O(n) time for each index.\\n     - Overall, the loop in `triangleNumber` runs n-2 times, resulting in O(n^2) time complexity.\\n\\n4. **Space Complexity**:\\n   - The code uses a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is O(1).\\n\\nIn summary, the code efficiently solves the problem by applying the triangle inequality rule using a two-pointer approach. It sorts the input array and counts the valid triangles that can be formed.\",\n          \"```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def backspaceCompare(self, string: str, target: str) -> bool:\\n        \\n        return self.solOne(string, target)\\n        return self.solTwo(string, target)\\n    \\n    \\n#     O(n) || O(1)\\n#  Runtime: 35ms 83.17% Memory: 14mb 22.92%\\n    def solOne(self, string, target):\\n        stringLength = len(string) -1 \\n        targetLength = len(target) -1\\n\\n        while stringLength >= 0 or targetLength >= 0:\\n            skipString = 0\\n            skipTarget = 0\\n\\n            while stringLength >= 0:\\n                if string[stringLength] == '#':\\n                    skipString += 1\\n                    stringLength -= 1\\n                elif skipString > 0:\\n                    stringLength -= 1\\n                    skipString -= 1\\n                else:\\n                    break\\n\\n            while targetLength >= 0:\\n                if target[targetLength] == '#':\\n                    skipTarget += 1\\n                    targetLength -= 1\\n                elif skipTarget > 0:\\n                    targetLength -= 1\\n                    skipTarget -= 1\\n                else:\\n                    break\\n\\n            if (stringLength >= 0) != (targetLength >= 0):\\n                return False\\n\\n            if stringLength >= 0 and targetLength >= 0 and string[stringLength] != target[targetLength]:\\n                return False\\n\\n            stringLength -= 1\\n            targetLength -= 1\\n\\n        return True\\n    \\n#     O(n) || O(n)\\n#   Runtime: 43ms 57.50% memory: 13.8mb 73.28%\\n    def solTwo(self, string, target):\\n        stackOne, stackTwo = [], []\\n        \\n        for i in string:\\n            if i == '#':\\n                if stackOne:\\n                    stackOne.pop()\\n                    \\n            else:\\n                stackOne.append(i)\\n                \\n        for i in target:\\n            if i == '#':\\n                if stackTwo:\\n                    stackTwo.pop()\\n            else:\\n                stackTwo.append(i)\\n                \\n                \\n        return stackOne == stackTwo\\n```\\n\\n\\nThe given code is a Python solution to the LeetCode problem 844, which involves comparing two strings that may contain backspace characters ('#'). The code provides two different solutions to solve the problem. Let's analyze each solution in detail:\\n\\nSolution One (solOne):\\n- This solution uses two pointers to iterate through the strings while considering the backspace characters.\\n- It iterates from the end of both strings towards the beginning.\\n- It uses two variables, skipString and skipTarget, to keep track of the number of backspaces encountered in each string.\\n- It compares characters at the current positions of the pointers, taking into account any backspaces encountered.\\n- The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the longer string. The space complexity is O(1) as no extra space is used apart from a few variables.\\n\\nSolution Two (solTwo):\\n- This solution uses two stacks (stackOne and stackTwo) to simulate the effect of backspace characters.\\n- It iterates through each character of both strings, pushing characters onto the stack or popping characters from the stack based on encountering '#' or other characters.\\n- After processing both strings, it compares the contents of the two stacks to determine if the strings are equal after applying backspaces.\\n- The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the longer string. The space complexity is O(n) as the stacks can store up to n characters.\\n\\nOverall, both solutions provide a valid approach to solving the problem. Solution One is more optimized in terms of space complexity, while Solution Two is easier to understand and implement.\\n\\nIn terms of performance, Solution One is faster in terms of runtime as it avoids using extra space. Solution Two, on the other hand, provides a clearer and more intuitive way of handling the backspace characters.\\n\\nFor the given problem constraints, either solution can be used to achieve the desired outcome.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1640,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Matrix Cells in Distance Order\",\n          \"Count Vowel Substrings of a String\",\n          \"Minimum Swaps to Arrange a Binary Grid\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title_slug\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1641,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"matrix-cells-in-distance-order\",\n          \"count-vowel-substrings-of-a-string\",\n          \"minimum-swaps-to-arrange-a-binary-grid\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1641,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"You are given four integers `row`, `cols`, `rCenter`, and `cCenter`.
